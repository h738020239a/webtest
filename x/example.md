# What is Speechy?

Allows data to be encoded inside of audio waves using audible or inaudible ultrasound tones to a receiver 

<br>
<br>

- üîê **Security** - focus on security
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Friendly** - multiply languages
- üéß **Transfer** - only requires a speaker
- üé§ **Receive** - listens continuously
- üì§ **Portable** - runs on any device
- üõ† **Hackable** - anything is possible

<!--
The first contact with a programming language should be as simple as possible. And Python is an easy-to-learn programming language that has some really useful features for a beginning programmer. The code is quite easy to read when compared to other programming languages, and it has an interactive shell into which you can enter your programs and see them run.
In addition to its simple language structure and an interactive shell with which to experiment, Python has some features that greatly augment the learning process and allow you to put together simple animations for creating your own games.
For example, with one line of code, it possible to create a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù program and in two lines it is possible to create a code in which the computer requests the user‚Äôs name and returns it with a length ‚Äî or any other simple operation with the user‚Äôs name string. If that same code is written in Java, C or Pascal, you must use eight or nine lines of code.
Another good reason is that Kids Won‚Äôt Outgrow Python. Scientists use Python to work with large data sets. Software engineers build neural networks and other forms of artificial intelligence with this versatile language.
Also most popular kid's games, like Minecraft and Roblox, provide a good Python API that allows more advanced users to extend the game‚Äôs capabilities and resources, offering new game experiences, which, in my particular case, has increased curiosity and desire of my son learning Python.

# Install

Few things to get us up and running
* pyaudio allows to use the audio device
* numpy allows us to do calculations on the audio
* speechy is the software that send and recieves audio data


```bash
python3 -m pip install pyaudio, numpy, speechy
```

# Send a message

Send an encoded message

```py
""" Send data """
def snd(name):
    cmd = './speak -dk ' + name + ' -sp 1 -o demo.wav -m 0'
    os.system(cmd)
```

Output:
